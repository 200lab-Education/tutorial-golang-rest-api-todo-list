# TODO REST API Service

This is a very simple Golang REST API service. My full tutorial article (in Vietnamese) has been published at https://200lab.io/blog/lap-trinh-rest-api-todo-list-voi-golang/

# How to run this service
- Make sure you've already had Golang & MySQL installed on your local machine.
- Clone this repository
- Use Terminal, change directory to your folder an run command `MYSQL_CONNECTION='YOUR_MYSQL_CONNECTION_STRING' go run main.go`
- If everything is OK. A service is running and listen at port 8080.
